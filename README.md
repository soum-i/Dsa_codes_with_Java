This repo is my Java + DSA grind zone 
I push codes here while learning, practicing, and getting better at problem-solving.

What’s inside

Core Java concepts

DSA basics → advanced

Stuff like:

Arrays & Strings

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Recursion

Sorting & Searching

Trees, Graphs (coming soon 👀)

Why this repo exists

To stay consistent

To track my progress

To build strong logic for interviews & real dev work



Notes

Codes may look messy sometimes — it’s a learning repo, not a flex repo 😌

I update this regularly as I practice more problems.
